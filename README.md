Imagine that there is a submarine diving into the enemy sea, but the enemies may plant mines to repel the submarines, so this submarine will have to determine whether what it encounters is a mine or just a rock.
So I have built this Model to predict if the object is a Mine or just a Rock
I have built this model using Logistic Regression model because it is good with linear classification
i have used the data set that contains about 200 samples mixed between mins and rocks
i also built a prediction system to take qualifications and tell if the object is a rock or a mine
